## Key Writing Patterns

### 1. Opening Achievement Statement

Lead with clinical/practical relevance:

```
"The [system name] can facilitate [clinical application] by [key capability].
Its design features [advantage 1] and [advantage 2], enhancing [practical benefit]."
```

### 2. Quantitative Summary

Include key performance metrics:

```
"Using [system], we achieved [performance metric 1] with [performance metric 2].
The assay required only [time] and [sample volume], compared to [gold standard]
([standard metrics])."
```

### 3. Prior Work Context

Position within the field:

```
"Building on previous approaches [citations], [system] advances the field by
[key innovation]. Unlike [prior method] which required [limitation], [system]
enables [improvement]."
```

### 4. Limitation Acknowledgment Pattern (CRITICAL)

Honest but balanced:

```
"One limitation of [approach] is [specific issue]. We compensated for this by
[mitigation strategy]. However, [remaining challenge] warrants further investigation."
```

### 5. Three-Tier Future Directions

Organized by timeline:

**Immediate (Technical)**:
```
"Future work will focus on [specific optimization], which could further improve
[performance aspect]."
```

**Short-term (Expansion)**:
```
"The platform can be extended to detect [additional targets], expanding its
utility for [broader applications]."
```

**Long-term (Translation)**:
```
"Prospective clinical studies will be needed to validate [system] as a reliable
tool for [clinical application]."
```

### 6. Broader Impact Statement

End with societal significance:

```
"[System] represents a promising platform for [application] that could help
[impact: decentralize diagnostics, empower patients, reduce healthcare disparities]
in [target setting]."
```

- Improve particle engineering
```

### Output
```markdown
## Conclusions

The [system] platform can facilitate rapid, on-site biomarker detection by
leveraging the unique properties of [technology]. The system achieved detection
within 15 min with sensitivity of 50 pM, enabling analysis from minimal sample
volumes. In clinical validation with [n] patient samples, [system] demonstrated
88% sensitivity and 91% specificity for [disease] detection, comparable to
laboratory-based [gold standard].

One limitation of [approach] is the low quantum yield of [component] (<1%).
We compensated for this through [strategy], which enhanced signal-to-noise
ratio. Future particle engineering efforts could further improve optical
properties and enable [enhanced capability].

The platform can be extended to incorporate additional biomarkers, potentially
improving diagnostic accuracy for [application]. Multiplexed detection of
[related targets] would enable [clinical benefit]. Prospective clinical studies
will be needed to validate [system] as a reliable tool for [clinical application].

[System] represents a promising platform for point-of-care diagnostics that
could help decentralize healthcare delivery and improve access in resource-limited
settings. By providing rapid, quantitative results without specialized equipment,
[system] may empower clinicians to make timely treatment decisions and improve
patient outcomes.

## Anti-Patterns (AVOID)

| Pattern | Problem | Correction |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Hiding limitations | Appears evasive | Acknowledge honestly with mitigation |
| Overclaiming | Undermines credibility | Use appropriate hedging |
| Vague future directions | Not actionable | Provide specific 3-tier timeline |
| Missing impact statement | Incomplete conclusion | End with broader significance |
| Repeating Results | Redundant | Synthesize and interpret, don't repeat |
