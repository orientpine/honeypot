## Key Writing Patterns

### 1. Opening with Clinical Need

Start with disease burden or clinical problem:

```
"[Disease] affects [X million] people worldwide, with [Y%] occurring in
[population/region]. Early detection is critical for [clinical outcome],
yet current screening methods remain [limitation]."
```

### 2. Problem Statement with Data

Quantify the problem:

```
"[Current method] requires [limitation 1: cost/time/expertise], making it
[inaccessible/impractical] for [target setting]. The sensitivity of [method]
is limited to [X], insufficient for [clinical need]."
```

### 3. Unmet Need Statement

Explicitly state the gap:

```
"These realities underline the unmet need for [desired characteristics],
ideally [additional requirements] in [target setting]."
```

### 4. Solution Introduction Pattern (CRITICAL)

Use delayed revelation after establishing need:

```
"Here, we present [System Name] ([Full Name]) for [application]. The
[system] integrates [component 1] with [component 2], enabling [key capability].
[System] leverages [key innovation] to achieve [performance metric]."
```

### 5. Validation Preview

End with scope of demonstration:

```
"We validate [system] using [sample types] from [patient population] (n=[X])
and demonstrate its potential for [clinical application]."
```

## Vocabulary Patterns

### Problem Domain
- limitations, challenges, insufficient, laborious
- limited sensitivity, high cost, time-consuming
- resource-intensive, technically demanding
- healthcare disparities, underserved populations

### Solution Domain
- integrates, combines, streamlines, leverages
- enables, facilitates, addresses, overcomes
- rapid, sensitive, specific, portable
- point-of-care, resource-limited settings

## Transformation Example

### Input
```
Disease: Cervical cancer
Statistics: 600,000 new cases/year, 80% in LMICs
Current method: PCR
Limitations: Expensive equipment, trained personnel
Our solution: CreDiT (CRISPR Enhanced Digital Testing)
Technology: CRISPR + digital signal processing
Key advantages: Rapid, affordable, point-of-care
Validation: 121 clinical samples
```

### Output
```markdown
Addressing the global disparity in cancer care necessitates the development
of rapid and affordable nucleic acid (NA) testing technologies. Cervical
cancer alone accounts for over 600,000 new cases a year, with more than 80%
of them occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [REF-WHO2020A].
Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) is the
primary cause of cervical cancer, and screening for hrHPV NAs has been shown
to be more effective than cytology-based Pap tests [REF-RONCO2014A].

The primary assay method, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), incurs high fixed
and operational costs that strain healthcare systems in LMICs [REF-FIELDS2016A].
Visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) is a rapid, inexpensive alternative
but suffers from poor accuracy. These realities underline the unmet need for
fast, accurate hrHPV testing, ideally administered at point-of-care in LMIC
settings.

Here, we present CreDiT (CRISPR Enhanced Digital Testing) for on-site NA
detection. The CreDiT platform integrates a one-pot CRISPR strategy for
concurrent NA amplification and sensing with a robust fluorescent detection
method based on the Walsh-Hadamard transform (WHT). This approach enables
sensitive and specific detection within 30 min using a compact, battery-powered
device. We validate CreDiT for hrHPV detection using clinical cervical samples
(n = 121) and demonstrate its potential as a portable diagnostic platform for
decentralized testing.

## Anti-Patterns (AVOID)

| Pattern | Problem | Correction |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Starting with "In recent years..." | Cliche opening | Start with specific clinical need |
| Vague problem statements | Not compelling | Quantify with epidemiological data |
| Premature solution reveal | Undermines narrative | Build tension before introducing solution |
| Missing validation preview | Incomplete setup | End with scope of demonstration |
| Over-citation in first paragraph | Distracting | Save citations for specific claims |
