## Title Philosophy

{{ name | title }} 논문 제목은 **"Technology -> Application"** 구조를 따릅니다:

1. **Core innovation** (이 연구의 독창성)
2. **Clinical/practical utility** (왜 중요한지)
3. **Specificity** (어떤 문제를 해결하는지)

## Title Patterns

### Pattern 1: Technology + for + Application
**Structure**: `[Core Technology/Method] for [Benefit/Speed] [Target Disease] [diagnosis/detection]`

**Examples**:
{% for pattern in title.patterns.technology_application[:3] %}
- "{{ pattern }}"
{% endfor %}

**When to use**: When the technology itself is the main innovation

### Pattern 2: Sample/Analyte + Analysis Method + identifies + Outcome
**Structure**: `[Sample] [Analyte] [Method] identifies [diagnostic markers] for [Disease]`

**When to use**: When the discovery of specific biomarkers/patterns is the main contribution

### Pattern 3: Enabling Statement
**Structure**: `[Action verb] [target] via/using [method] at [setting]`

**When to use**: When emphasizing accessibility or simplicity of the approach

## Core Elements to Include

### 1. Technology Identifier (REQUIRED)

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Detection Method | Fluorescence polarization, Electrochemical sensing |
| Platform Type | System, Device, Assay, Platform |
| Architectural Feature | Two-phase, Integrated, Microfluidic |
| Analysis Approach | N-glycomics, Proteomics, CRISPR-based |

### 2. Clinical Benefit (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED)

| Benefit Type | Keywords |
|--------------|----------|
| Speed | rapid, real-time, immediate |
| Accessibility | point-of-care, portable, handheld |
| Simplicity | unprocessed, wash-free, one-pot |
| Sensitivity | ultrasensitive, single-molecule, early-stage |

### 3. Application Target (REQUIRED)

| Element | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| Disease | bladder cancer, COVID-19, liver cancer |
| Function | diagnosis, detection, monitoring, screening |
| Sample Type | urine, blood, saliva (if key to innovation) |

## Title Construction Rules

### DO:
- Lead with your technology/method
- Use "for" to connect technology to application
- Include ONE key advantage (don't overload)
- Keep total length: 8-15 words optimal
- Be specific about the disease/target

### DON'T:
- Use "Novel" or "New" (assumed for publications)
- Include system acronyms in title (save for abstract)
- List multiple diseases unless truly multiplex
- Use vague terms like "improved" or "enhanced"
- Make the title a full sentence

## Length Guidelines

| Journal Type | Target Words | Characters |
|--------------|--------------|------------|
| Nature family | 8-12 words | 60-90 chars |
| Science | 8-12 words | 60-90 chars |
| Cell | 10-15 words | 80-120 chars |
| Specialty journals | 12-18 words | 100-150 chars |

## Field-Specific Keywords

{% for term in field_characteristics.keywords[:8] %}
- {{ term }}
{% endfor %}

## Title Generation Process

### Step 1: Identify Core Innovation
What is the single most important technological advance?

### Step 2: Identify Key Advantage
What makes this clinically valuable?
- Faster than existing methods?
- Simpler workflow?
- Higher sensitivity?

### Step 3: Identify Target Application
What specific problem does it solve?

### Step 4: Apply Pattern
Select the most appropriate pattern and construct:

```
Pattern 1 (Technology-focused):
[Technology] + for + [advantage] + [disease] + [function]

Pattern 2 (Discovery-focused):
[Sample] + [analyte] + [method] + identifies + [markers] + for + [disease]

Pattern 3 (Utility-focused):
[Function] + of + [target] + via/using + [method] + at + [setting]
```

### Step 5: Refine
- Remove redundant words
- Check word count (aim for 8-15)
- Verify specificity
- Test readability

## Transformation Examples

### Example 1: CRISPR-based POC Device

**Input**:
```
Technology: CRISPR-Cas12a with isothermal amplification
Device: Smartphone-integrated portable reader
Target: HPV DNA detection for cervical cancer screening
Key advantage: 30-minute results, battery-powered, $5/test
Setting: Low-resource clinics (LMICs)
```

**Output Options**:
1. "CRISPR-based point-of-care device for rapid HPV detection"
2. "A portable CRISPR diagnostic platform for cervical cancer screening"
3. "Smartphone-integrated CRISPR assay for HPV detection in resource-limited settings"

**Selected**: Option 1 (most concise, technology-forward)

### Example 2: EV-based Cancer Detection

**Input**:
```
Technology: Electrochemical aptamer sensor
Analyte: Exosomal surface proteins (CD63, EpCAM)
Target: Pancreatic cancer early detection
Key advantage: Detects from 50 uL serum, 15-minute readout
Setting: Clinical laboratory
```

**Output Options**:
1. "Electrochemical aptasensor for rapid detection of pancreatic cancer exosomes"
2. "Exosomal protein profiling for early pancreatic cancer diagnosis"
3. "An aptamer-based electrochemical platform for cancer exosome detection"

**Selected**: Option 1 (technology + speed + specific target)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Example | Better Version |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Too vague | "A new biosensor for cancer" | "Electrochemical aptasensor for bladder cancer detection" |
| Too long | "Development of a novel highly sensitive..." | "Ultrasensitive platform for..." |
| Acronym overload | "CRISPR-RPA-LFA for POC detection" | "CRISPR-based point-of-care diagnostics" |
| Missing target | "Fluorescence polarization assay" | "Fluorescence polarization assay for exosome detection" |
