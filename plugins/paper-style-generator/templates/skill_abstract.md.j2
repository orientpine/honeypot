## Style Overview

- **Structure**: Background → Methods → Results → Conclusions (IMRAD condensed)
- **Length**: {{ abstract.word_count.mean | round }}-{{ abstract.word_count.max | round }} words
- **Voice**: {{ abstract.voice.active.mean * 100 | round }}% active, {{ abstract.voice.passive.mean * 100 | round }}% passive
- **Tense**: Present for conclusions, past for methods/results
- **Tone**: Direct, quantitative, impact-focused

## Section Flow

```
Sentence 1-2: Clinical/Scientific Problem
    ↓
Sentence 3-4: Current Limitations
    ↓
Sentence 5: Solution Introduction ("Here, we present...")
    ↓
Sentence 6-7: Key Technical Approach
    ↓
Sentence 8-10: Main Results (quantitative)
    ↓
Sentence 11-12: Clinical Implications
```

## Key Writing Patterns

### 1. Opening Problem Statement

Lead with clinical significance:

```
"[Disease/Challenge] remains a major [healthcare/scientific] challenge, 
affecting [X] million people worldwide."
```

### 2. Limitation Bridge

Connect to unmet need:

```
"Current [methods/approaches] are limited by [limitation 1] and [limitation 2], 
hindering [clinical goal]."
```

### 3. Solution Introduction (CRITICAL)

Use the signature phrase:

```
"Here, we present [System Name], a [brief description] for [application]."
```

### 4. Technical Summary

Concise method description:

```
"[System] integrates [component 1] with [component 2], enabling 
[key capability] within [time/simplicity]."
```

### 5. Results Presentation

Quantitative, specific:

```
"In [n] clinical samples, [system] achieved [sensitivity]% sensitivity 
and [specificity]% specificity (AUC = [value])."
```

### 6. Impact Statement

End with clinical relevance:

```
"[System] provides a [rapid/sensitive/accessible] tool for [application], 
with potential to [clinical impact]."
```

## Vocabulary Patterns

### Problem Domain
{% for term in abstract.high_freq_words.problem[:5] %}
- {{ term }}
{% endfor %}

### Solution Domain
{% for term in abstract.high_freq_words.solution[:5] %}
- {{ term }}
{% endfor %}

### Results Domain
{% for term in abstract.high_freq_words.results[:5] %}
- {{ term }}
{% endfor %}

## Transformation Example

### Input
```
System: SCOPE2 (Signal-amplified CRISPR-based Optical Platform for Exosomes)
Target: Bladder cancer detection from urine
Key tech: CRISPR-Cas12a + fluorescence polarization
Performance: 92% sensitivity, 89% specificity, AUC 0.94
Sample: 156 clinical urine samples
Time: 45 minutes
```

### Output
```markdown
Bladder cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related morbidity, yet early 
detection remains challenging due to the invasive nature of cystoscopy and 
limited sensitivity of urine cytology. Here, we present SCOPE2, a 
signal-amplified CRISPR-based platform for rapid, non-invasive detection of 
bladder cancer biomarkers in urine. SCOPE2 integrates isothermal amplification 
with CRISPR-Cas12a trans-cleavage activity, read out via fluorescence 
polarization for enhanced specificity. The platform detects multiple mRNA 
markers within 45 minutes from unprocessed urine samples. In a clinical 
validation study with 156 patient samples, SCOPE2 achieved 92% sensitivity 
and 89% specificity (AUC = 0.94) for bladder cancer detection, outperforming 
conventional urine cytology. SCOPE2 provides a rapid, non-invasive tool for 
bladder cancer screening with potential to improve early detection in 
clinical settings.

## Anti-Patterns (AVOID)

| Pattern | Problem | Correction |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Vague claims ("improved detection") | Not quantitative | Use specific numbers |
| Method-heavy abstract | Buries results | Lead with problem, emphasize results |
| Missing clinical context | Unclear impact | Always frame clinical significance |
| Passive throughout | Less engaging | Use active voice for key findings |

## Word Count Guidelines

| Target Journal | Word Limit | Recommended |
|----------------|------------|-------------|
| Nature family | 150 words | 140-150 |
| Science | 125 words | 120-125 |
| Cell | 150 words | 140-150 |
| Specialty journals | 200-300 words | Follow journal guidelines |
