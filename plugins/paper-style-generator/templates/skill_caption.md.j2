# {{ name | title }}-Style Caption Writer

## Style Overview

- **Structure**: Bold title + Panel-by-panel descriptions
- **Voice**: Present tense for descriptions, past tense for methods/results
- **Precision**: All measurements include exact values with units
- **Statistics**: Error bars, sample sizes, P-values clearly stated

## Caption Components

### 1. Figure Title (Required)

**Standard format:**
```
**Figure [N]. [Descriptive title].**
```

**Nature journal format:**
```
**Fig. [N] | [Descriptive title].**
```

- Title should summarize the entire figure's purpose
- Use sentence case
- Standard journals: period after title
- Nature main journals: pipe separator `|` between number and title

### 2. Panel Descriptions (Required for multi-panel figures)

**Standard format (most journals):**
```
(a) [Description of panel a]. (b) [Description of panel b]. ...
```

**Nature journal format (alternative):**
```
a, [Description]. b, [Description]. ...
```

- Each panel labeled with **lowercase letter**
- Parentheses `(a)` for most journals; comma `a,` for Nature main journals
- Descriptions are complete sentences or noun phrases
- Flow logically from schematic to data to analysis

### 3. Statistical Information (Required for data figures)

Include at end of caption:
- Error bar definition: `Error bars represent mean +/- SD (n = 3).`
- Sample size: `(n = X)`
- Statistical test: `P-value from two-tailed t-test.`
- Significance markers: `*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.`

## Figure Caption Templates

### Device/Platform Figure

```markdown
**Figure 1. [System name] platform for [application].**
(a) Schematic of the [system] device showing [component 1], [component 2],
and [component 3]. (b) Photograph of the assembled device. Scale bar, [X] cm.
(c) [System] assay workflow: [step 1], [step 2], and [step 3].
(d) Representative signals from [positive/negative] samples.
```

### Optimization Figure

```markdown
**Figure 2. Assay optimization and characterization.**
(a) Effect of [parameter 1] on [performance metric]. [Optimal value] was
selected for subsequent experiments. (b) [Parameter 2] optimization showing
[observation]. (c) Calibration curve for [target] detection. LOD = [value].
(d) Specificity test against [n] interferents. Error bars represent mean +/- SD
(n = 3).
```

### Clinical Validation Figure

```markdown
**Figure 3. Clinical validation of [system].**
(a) [Target] levels in [disease] patients (n = [X]) and healthy controls
(n = [Y]). Box plots show median with interquartile range; whiskers extend
to 1.5x IQR. (b) ROC curve analysis. AUC = [value] (95% CI: [range]).
(c) Correlation with [gold standard] (R2 = [value]). P-value from [test].
```

## Table Caption Templates

### Results Summary Table

```markdown
**Table 2. Diagnostic performance of [system] across patient cohorts.**
Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV calculated using [gold standard] as
reference. 95% confidence intervals shown in parentheses.
```

### Comparison Table

```markdown
**Table 4. Comparison of [system] with existing detection methods.**
Performance metrics compiled from published literature. NA, not available;
ND, not determined.
```

## Writing Conventions

### Measurement Formatting

{% for mtype, mformat in measurement_format.items() %}
| {{ mtype | title }} | `{{ mformat.pattern }}` | {{ mformat.examples[0] if mformat.examples else 'N/A' }} |
{% endfor %}

### Statistical Notation

| Element | Format | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Correlation | `R2 = [value]` | R2 = 0.931 |
| P-value | `P < [value]` or `P = [value]` | P < 0.001 |
| Confidence interval | `95% CI: [range]` | 95% CI: 0.82-0.96 |
| Error definition | `mean +/- [SD/s.e.m.]` | mean +/- SD |

### Panel References

**Standard format:**
- Single panel: `(a)`, `(b)`, `(c)`
- Panel range: `(a-c)`, `(d-f)`
- Specific panels: `(a, c and e)`
- Insets: `(a, inset)`

## Transformation Example

### Input
```
Figure 3: LOD experiment
- Panel A: titration curve, serial dilution 1pM to 1uM
- Panel B: specificity, tested 5 similar targets
- Panel C: reproducibility, 3 days, 3 operators
- LOD was 50pM
- n=3 for all
```

### Output
```markdown
**Figure 3. Analytical performance of the [system] assay.**
(a) Calibration curve for [target] detection. Serial dilutions ranging from
1 pM to 1 uM were tested. The limit of detection was 50 pM (mean + 3sigma of blank).
(b) Specificity evaluation against five structurally similar targets. [Target]
produced significantly higher signal than all non-targets. (c) Reproducibility
assessment across three days with three independent operators. Intra-assay and
inter-assay CVs were <10%. Error bars represent mean +/- SD (n = 3).
```

## Anti-Patterns (AVOID)

| Pattern | Problem | Correction |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Vague titles | Not informative | "Results" -> "Clinical validation of iMEX in pancreatic cancer" |
| Missing statistics | Incomplete | Always include n, error type, P-values |
| Inconsistent panel labeling | Confusing | Use lowercase `(a)`, `(b)` consistently |
| Undefined abbreviations | Unclear | Define on first use in caption |
| Missing scale bars | Incomplete | All micrographs need scale information |
