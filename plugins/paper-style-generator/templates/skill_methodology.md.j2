# {{ name | title }}-Style Methodology Writer

## Style Overview

- **Voice**: {{ methodology.voice.active.mean * 100 | round }}% active, {{ methodology.voice.passive.mean * 100 | round }}% passive
- **Tense**: Past tense predominantly ({{ methodology.tense.past.mean * 100 | round }}%)
- **Precision**: All measurements include exact values with units
- **Structure**: Integrated paragraphs with inline headings
- **Paragraph Length**: {{ methodology.word_count.mean // 100 * 10 }}-{{ methodology.word_count.mean // 100 * 10 + 5 }} lines per section

## Section Order (Standard)

{% if methodology.subsection_order %}
{% for subsection in methodology.subsection_order %}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ subsection }}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
1. Ethical statement / IRB approval
2. Materials (reagents, chemicals, suppliers)
3. Device/system construction
4. Assay procedures
5. Cell culture
6. Sample isolation
7. Clinical specimen processing
8. Quantitative methods
9. Statistical analysis
{% endif %}

## Key Writing Patterns

### 1. Inline Heading Format (CRITICAL)

```markdown
# CORRECT (Inline heading)
**Ethical statement.** This study was approved by the Institutional Review 
Boards of [Institution] (protocol [number]).

# INCORRECT (Separate heading)
**Ethical statement**

This study was approved by...
```

### 2. Passive Voice Transformations

| Active (Avoid) | Passive (Preferred) |
|----------------|---------------------|
| We prepared samples | Samples were prepared |
| We incubated the mixture | The mixture was incubated |
| We centrifuged for 10 min | Samples were centrifuged for 10 min |
| We added 100 µL of buffer | Buffer (100 µL) was added |
| We washed the beads | The beads were washed |

### 3. Measurement Formatting

{% for mtype, mformat in measurement_format.items() %}
- **{{ mtype | title }}**: `{{ mformat.pattern }}`
{% endfor %}

### 4. Supplier Citation

- **Format**: `"Product (Catalog#, Manufacturer)"`
- **Examples**: 
  - Dynabeads M-270 (14302D, Invitrogen)
  - Luna Universal qPCR Master Mix (New England BioLabs)

## High Frequency Verbs

{% for verb, count in methodology.high_freq_verbs[:10] %}
- {{ verb }}
{% endfor %}

## Transformation Example

### Input
```
Bead preparation:
- 5 mg magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-270 Epoxy, Invitrogen, 14302D)
- Add 100 µg antibodies
- Incubate overnight at 4°C with rotation
- Wash twice with PBS
```

### Output
```markdown
**Preparation of immunomagnetic beads.** Magnetic beads (5 mg; 14302D, 
Dynabeads M-270 Epoxy, Invitrogen) were suspended in 0.1 M sodium phosphate 
solution at room temperature for 10 min. The beads were magnetically 
separated, resuspended, and incubated with antibodies (100 µg) overnight 
at 4°C with slow rotation. Following two washes with PBS, the conjugated 
beads were resuspended in PBS containing 1% BSA and stored at 4°C.
```

## Anti-Patterns (AVOID)

| Pattern | Problem | Correction |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Separate heading line | Breaks reading flow | Use inline `**Title.** Content...` |
| One paragraph per step | Over-fragmented | Combine related steps |
| Every detail in main text | Too verbose | Move to Supplementary |
| "...were prepared as follows:" | Filler | Start directly with procedure |
