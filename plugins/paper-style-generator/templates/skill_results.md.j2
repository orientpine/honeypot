# {{ name | title }}-Style Results Writer

## Core Principles (CRITICAL)

1. **Result-Centric Narrative**: Lead with what the data shows, not what you did
2. **Theme-Based Structure**: 3-5 major sections, NOT one section per experiment
3. **Reduced "We" Usage**: Maximum {{ (results.we_usage.mean * 100) | round }}% of sentences start with "We"
4. **Integrated Figure References**: Group related figures (Fig. 2a,b)
5. **Extreme Brevity**: Convey findings in 50% fewer words

## Style Overview

- **Voice**: {{ results.voice.active.mean * 100 | round }}% active, {{ results.voice.passive.mean * 100 | round }}% passive
- **Tense**: Past tense for experiments, present for established methods
- **Figure Integration**: Grouped, panel-specific references
- **Subsection Count**: 3-5 major themes

## Section Structure (Theme-Based)

### Preferred Structure
```
**[System] assay flow**
  - Platform overview and working principle
    ↓
**Assay characterization**
  - Optimization results (combined)
  - Analytical performance (LOD, dynamic range)
    ↓
**[System] performance for [target] detection**
  - Validation experiments
  - Gold standard comparison
    ↓
**[System] for [application]**
  - Clinical performance
```

### Anti-Pattern: Over-Fragmented (AVOID)
```
❌ Signal template optimization
❌ Time-resolved signal kinetics  
❌ Reproducibility assessment
❌ Sensitivity for protein detection
❌ Specificity for protein detection
...etc (15+ sections)
```

## Key Writing Patterns

### 1. Sentence Starter Diversification (CRITICAL)

**Target**: Maximum {{ (results.we_usage.mean * 100) | round }}% of sentences start with "We"

| "We" Sentence | Result-Centric Alternative |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| "We validated the probe..." | "The analytical signal (∆r) was maximal when..." |
| "We observed that..." | "[Observation] was observed in..." |
| "We determined the LOD..." | "The limit of detection was established at..." |
| "We developed..." | "[System] was built upon..." |
| "We compared..." | "In comparison with [method], [system] demonstrated..." |

### 2. Platform Description (Result-Centric)

```markdown
❌ AVOID: "We developed [system], an integrated platform for..."

✓ PREFERRED: "[System] was built upon [previous work], which was developed 
for [application]. At the core of [system] is [key component]."
```

### 3. Figure Reference Patterns

| Pattern | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| `"(**Fig. 1a**)"` | Parenthetical (preferred) |
| `"(**Fig. 3a,b**)"` | Grouped panels |
| `"(**Supplementary Fig. 1**)"` | Supplementary references |

### 4. Quantitative Expressions

- Limit of detection: `"LOD of 10 pM"`
- Dynamic range: `"spanning 4 orders of magnitude"`
- Fold changes: `"~70-fold enhancement"`
- Correlation: `"R² = 0.931"`

## Transformation Example

### Input (Over-Fragmented)
```markdown
**Sensitivity for protein detection**

We determined the analytical sensitivity of SCOPE for protein detection by 
analyzing serially diluted CD63 protein (Figure 3e).

**Specificity for protein detection**

We evaluated the specificity of SCOPE by testing probes against non-cognate 
targets (Figure 3f)...
```

### Output (Integrated, Result-Led)
```markdown
**SCOPE2 performance for protein and RNA detection**

We applied SCOPE2 for unified detection of protein and RNA targets. The 
analytical signal (∆r) was maximal when all required elements were present 
(**Fig. 3a**). In a titration experiment (**Fig. 3b**), SCOPE2 demonstrated 
both a broader dynamic range and higher sensitivity compared to conventional 
ELISA. The limit of detection was 50 pM with SCOPE2, whereas ELISA achieved 
only 5 nM—a 100-fold improvement.
```

## Anti-Patterns (AVOID)

| Pattern | Problem | Correction |
|---------|---------|------------|
| "We first... We next..." | Monotonous | Vary starters; lead with results |
| Separate section per experiment | Over-fragmented | Combine by theme (3-5 sections) |
| "(Figure 2A). (Figure 2B)." | Fragmented | "(**Fig. 2a-c**)" grouped |
